# Color Stage Chrome Extension

#### I made this Chrome extension in order to help developers easily identify which deployment environment account they're currently signed in on AWS.

It works by retrieving the first letter from the account name, which in my case is:
- "d" for "development"
- "s" for "staging"
- "p" for "production"

and for each letter assigning a different color on the page.
